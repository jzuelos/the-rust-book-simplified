# Day 7 -Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

## 1. Introduction

Today, we’re going to cover one of the most important parts of learning Rust — how to organize your code as your project grows.

When you first start writing Rust, everything might fit nicely in a single main.rs file. But as your program gets bigger, things can quickly get messy. That’s where packages, crates, and modules come in.

## 2. Packages and Crates

Packages are the containers that hold your Rust projects. 

A package can contain:
- One or more crates (projects or libraries).
- A Cargo.toml file (this is like the project’s recipe — it lists dependencies and metadata).

There are two main types of crates:
- **Binary crate** → makes an executable program (like cargo run).
- **Library crate** → provides reusable code (used by other crates).


## 3. Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy
When your Rust project grows, you’ll start having many functions, structs, and enums.
To keep everything neat and avoid name clashes, Rust lets you group related code into modules using the ```mod``` keyword.

Think of a module as a folder or section of your project — a place to group code that belongs together.

### Example: A Restaurant Analogy

Let’s say we’re building a restaurant app.
We could have different parts (modules) for the restaurant’s sections, like the front of the house and the back of the house.

The struct would look something like this : 
```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {
            println!("Added to waitlist!");
        }

        fn seat_at_table() {
            println!("Seating the customer...");
        }
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}
        fn serve_order() {}
        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```

### Breaking This Down

```mod front_of_house``` — defines a module named ```front_of_house```.

Inside it, we have two submodules:

- ```pub mod hosting```

- ```mod serving```

The pub keyword means public — it tells Rust that other parts of the program can use this module or function.If we don’t mark something as pub, Rust keeps it private by default, meaning it can only be used inside the same module.

So in our example:
```
add_to_waitlist() ✅ is public — other modules can call it.

seat_at_table() ❌ is private — only hosting can use it.
```

### Using the Module from Another Place

If you want to use ```add_to_waitlist()``` from outside (**like from** ```main.rs```), you’d write:

```
fn main() {
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```


### Here’s what’s happening:

- ```Crate``` means “start at the root of my current project.”
- Then we go down the tree:
  - ```front_of_house```
  - ```hosting```
  - ```add_to_waitlist()```


## 4. Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To use a function or struct inside a module, you need to refer to it by its path — kind of like how you use file paths in a computer.

There are two types of paths:

- **Absolute path** → starts from the root of your crate.

- **Relative path** → starts from where you currently are in the module tree.

💡 Example:
- 
```
crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // absolute
front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();        // relative
```

Think of it like finding a file:

```/home/user/docs/file.txt``` → **absolute**

```../docs/file.txt``` → **relative**

## 5. Bringing Paths Into Scope with the ```use``` Keyword

 The use keyword is a shortcut to make long paths shorter and cleaner.

Instead of writing:
```
crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
```

You can bring the path into scope:
```
use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

hosting::add_to_waitlist();
```

It’s like creating a desktop shortcut so you don’t have to dig through folders every time you want to open a file.

## 6. Separating Modules into Different Files

As your code grows, you can split modules into different files to stay organized.

**Example project structure:**
```
src/
 ├── main.rs
 ├── front_of_house.rs
 └── front_of_house/
      └── hosting.rs
```

In your main.rs or lib.rs, you declare:
```
mod front_of_house;
```

Rust automatically looks for:

```front_of_house.rs```, or

A folder named ```front_of_house``` containing a ```mod.rs``` or nested modules.

This keeps your codebase modular and easy to navigate — just like storing things in labeled boxes instead of one giant drawer.


## 7. Summary

| Concept       | Think of it like…       | What it does                         |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Package       | A full project          | Groups crates, has `Cargo.toml`    |
| Crate         | A house                 | A binary or library of Rust code   |
| Module        | A room in the house     | Organizes related code              |
| Path          | The address             | Shows how to reach an item          |
| `use` keyword | Shortcut                | Brings names into scope             |
| Separate files| Different rooms         | Keeps your code tidy                |
